# Address book app
Refactoring code on my old side-project.
In hope to learn and be more comfortable with TypeScripts and DUCKs redux file structure and feature-first file structure to build scalable project, I have started to refactor this simple addressBookApp which is the conventional functionality-first approach React app.
